1. Title: Detectance- Your main social distance detector.

2. Introduction:

2.1 Overview
Object detection Neural Network is used in various sectors. For example, it is 		deployed in the use of cleaning robots in the cleaning industry. In this application 		and aspect, the Object Detection Neural Network aims to help places detect and 		apply social distancing based in a video frame of 120x80 pixels. The yolo 			framework is also used in many types of object detection namely the classifying 		of objects into their various types. The yolo weights is trained by initialising the 		parameters and thus the pre trained given weights that give rise to the pre trained 		model in this case. Bounding boxes to detect person and then the distance between each person is determined by the non maxima suppression method.

The project uses three directories namely templates, packages and yolo coco to 		help keep the files in place.


2.2 Purpose
The project aims to detect people in frames through the while loop and then warn 	people to practise social distancing of 1m in this COVID-19 situation.

3. Result 
	3.1 Screenshots of output
	

The output as shown above cannot be derived due to the error that the tag cannot be supported with the mp4 format. This is most likely due to the OS that is based on the Mac. Hence the environment support for the file types may be different. Hence, a dual boot system for windows 10 can be better supported for an mp4 version.

4. Applications
The above can be applied to schools, public walks to help the law enforcement in each country to catch people who do not practise social distancing as required by modifying the minimum threshold.

5. Conclusion
To conclude, object detection neural networks through the use of the yolo framework can be accurate or cannot be highly accurate. Some limitations can include the file support types for the testing set as well as proper OS systems loaded to be more successful. Hence, such a framework can be applied to measure the distance between two objects through training and weights modifications.
